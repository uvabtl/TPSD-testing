# I2C Python3.6+ GUI for [FT260](https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT260.html) chip & CMS BTL power supply distribution board control

This GUI provides manual control over FT260 chip acting as USB to I2C master converter.
The FT260 is mounted on the CMS BTL power supply distribution control and is interfaced with two PCA9555 GPIO expanders.

The board is used to selectively power on/off the supplies of each (out of 6) Readout Unit (RU).

The power supplies are 3 (current consumption per RU):
* bPOL12V supply: <12 V, 4 A 
* TEC supply: max 32 V, 1 A
* ALDO supply: max 48 V, 0.1 A

## Functionality (generic I2C use)

I2C address scanner. It shows 7 bit addresses that acknowledge themselves on the bus.

Register read/write. Many devices have internal configuration registers. Register access is done by writing register 
address first, then either writing its new value, or initiating new read sequence to retrieve current value.
Register address size 8/16 bit and register word size 8/16/32 bit can be selected.     

I2C bus log. Every bus data transfer is given a sequential number, a timestamp, read/write feature,
slave device address, data content, start/stop flags and bus status.
Message byte order corresponds to the order of byte transfer on the bus.
Bus status flag is not decoded. You can reference it with FT260 documentation.

An standalone executable can be easily build with PyInstaller.

## Functionality (CMS BTL PS distribution board control)

The `Init board` button initializes the settings of the PCA9555s and sets the default of each channel to `off`.

The individual (`RU#`) `ON` or `OFF` buttons configure the corresponding switch.

The general `ALL PS&RU` and `ALL PS&RU` buttons configure all switches on the board, or all switches on a specific
power supply.

### IMPORTANT

The ALDO switches cannot be toggled (by hardware) if the input power supply is above 3 V.
If the user tries to do that, a warning appears and the setting is not applied.

## Requirements

Windows (fully tested) or Linux (beta support). Python 64-bit is required on Windows.
The GUI is built with tkinter library.

## Run Gui

* `pip install tkinter`
* `pip install smbus2` (Linux only)
* `python ftI2cGui.py`

## Build standalone application

* `pip install PyInstaller`
* `pyinstaller -wF ftI2cGui.py` to Build **dist\ftI2cGui.exe**
* `mkdir dist\lib && copy lib\LibFT260.dll dist\lib\`
* then you can run **ftI2cGui.exe** in dist directory
